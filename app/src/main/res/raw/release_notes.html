        <h3>Version 3.1.0 (March, 2024)</h3>
        <p>
            <br />
            <b>Rep announcement:</b>
            From now on, you don't have to see your phone during workouts because the app speaks the
            current rep count. You can adjust the volume separately in the volume popup.
            <br />
            <b>State saving:</b>
            You don't have to worry about an accidental app closure anymore. You're ongoing workout
            will be there when you open the app again.
        </p>
